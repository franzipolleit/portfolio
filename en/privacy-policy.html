        <h2>3. General and mandatory information</h2>

        <h3>Data protection</h3>

        <p>
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your 
          personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and 
          this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used 
          to identify you personally. This privacy statement explains what data we collect and what we use it 
          for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
        </p>

        <p>
          We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by email) 
          can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Information on the responsible body</h3>

        <p>The responsible body for data processing on this website is:</p>

        <p>
          Franziska Polleit<br>
          Bergmannstr. 63<br>
          01309 Dresden
        </p>
  
        <p>
          E-Mail: franziska.polleit[@]gmail.com
        </p>
          
        <p>
          The responsible body is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the 
          purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>Storage period</h3>

        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this data protection declaration, your 
          personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you 
          make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be 
          deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. 
          retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will take place once 
          these reasons no longer apply.
        </p>

        <h3>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</h3>

        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis of 
          Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, provided that special categories of data are processed in 
          accordance with Art. 9 (1) GDPR. In the case of an express consent to the transfer of personal data 
          to third countries, the data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. 
          If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to accessing information on your device (e.g. via 
          device fingerprinting), the data processing will also be carried out on the basis of § 25 (1) TDDDG. 
          Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfill the contract or to carry out 
          pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. Furthermore, 
          we will process your data if it is required to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of 
          Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR. Data processing can also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest 
          in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legal bases applicable in each individual case are 
          explained in the following paragraphs of this data protection declaration.
        </p>

        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>

        <p>
          As part of our business activities, we work with various external bodies. In some cases, it is also 
          necessary to transfer personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external 
          bodies if this is necessary in the context of fulfilling a contract, if we are legally obliged to do 
          so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer 
          according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis allows the data to be passed on. 
          When using contract processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a 
          valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing 
          is concluded.
        </p>

        <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>

        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your 
          consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the time of revocation 
          remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>

        <p>
          IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARAGRAPH 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE 
          THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM 
          YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE 
          LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, 
          WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR 
          THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE 
          PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
        </p>

        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT 
          AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; 
          THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING IN SO FAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, 
          YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION 
          ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
        </p>

        <h3>Right to complain to the responsible supervisory authority</h3>

        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have the right to lodge a complaint with a 
          supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work or 
          place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other 
          administrative or judicial remedies.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to data transferability</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in 
          fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. 
          If you request that the data be transferred directly to another responsible party, this will only be 
          done if it is technically feasible.
        </p>

        <h3>Information, correction and deletion</h3>

        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain free 
          information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing 
          and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time about 
          this and other questions on the subject of personal data.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted. You can contact 
          us at any time to do so. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. 
            For the duration of the check, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal 
            data be restricted.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request that the data processing be 
            restricted instead of deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it to exercise, defend or assert legal 
            claims, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted 
            instead of deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck 
            between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have 
            the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may 
          only be processed with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal 
          claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public 
          interest of the European Union or a member state.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data collection on this website</h2>

        <h3>Server log files</h3>

        <p>
          The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, 
          which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>browser type and browser version</li>
          <li>operating system used</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>hostname of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>date and time of the server request</li>
          <li>time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>HTTP status code</li>
          <li>content of the request</li>
          <li>amount of data transferred</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is no tracking and we have no direct access to this data.</p>

        <p>The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of processing no longer applies.</p>

        <p>This data will not be merged with other data sources.</p>

        <p>
          This data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate 
          interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website - for this purpose, 
          the server log files must be recorded.
        </p>

        <h3>Inquiry by email, telephone or fax</h3>

        <p>
          If you contact us by email, telephone or fax, your request, including all personal data (name, request) 
          resulting from it, will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. 
          We will not pass on this data without your consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, provided that your request is related to 
          the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other 
          cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests 
          addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) if this was requested; 
          the consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke 
          your consent to storage or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request 
          has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain 
          unaffected.
        </p>
